# Recommendation System

When you go to an e-commerce platform, one of the most important factors that induces you to make the actual purchase is how quickly are you able to locate the item you want to buy. One way in which ecommerce platforms achieve is through recommendation systems (also known as recommender systems), e.g. the ‘customers who bought this item also bought…’ section on Amazon. Almost all e-commerce platforms as well as movie & song streaming platforms like Amazon prime, Spotify, Netflix use a variation of recommendation system algorithm. The idea is to improve the user experience. There is an unwritten rule in any business - more happy is your customer, more is your profits.

## Types of Recommendation Systems
